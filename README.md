# Laminar

[Laminar](https://www.lmnr.ai) is an all-in-one open-source platform for engineering AI products. Trace, evaluate, label, and analyze LLM data.

- [x] Tracing
    - [x] OpenTelemetry-based automatic tracing of common AI frameworks and SDKs (LangChain, OpenAI, Anthropic ...) with just 2 lines of code. (powered by amazing [OpenLLMetry](https://github.com/traceloop/openllmetry)).
    - [x] Trace input/output, latency, cost, token count.
    - [x] Function tracing with `observe` decorator/wrapper.
    - [x] Image tracing.
    - [ ] Audio tracing coming soon.
- [x] Evaluations
    - [x] Local offline evaluations. Run from code, terminal or as part of CI/CD.
    - [x] Online evaluations. Trigger hosted LLM-as-a-judge or Python script evaluators for each trace.
- [x] Labels
    - [x] Simple UI for fast data labeling.
- [x] Datasets
    - [x] Export production trace data to datasets.
    - [x] Run evals on hosted golden datasets.
    - [X] Index dataset and retrieve semantically-similar dynamic few-shot examples to improve your prompts.
- [x] Built for scale
    - [x] Written in Rust ðŸ¦€
    - [x] Traces are sent via gRPC, ensuring the best performance and lowest overhead.
- [x] Modern Open-Source stack
    - [x] RabbitMQ for message queue, Postgres for data, Clickhouse for analytics. Qdrant for semantic similarity search and hybrid search.
- [x] Fast and beautiful dashboards for traces / evaluations / labels.

## Documentation

Check out full documentation here [docs.lmnr.ai](https://docs.lmnr.ai).

## Getting started

The fastest and easiest way to get started is with our managed platform -> [lmnr.ai](https://www.lmnr.ai)

### Self-hosting with Docker compose

For a quick start, clone the repo and start the services with docker compose:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/lmnr-ai/lmnr
cd lmnr
docker compose up -d
```

This will spin up a lightweight version of the stack with Postgres, app-server, and frontend. This is good for a quickstart 
or for lightweight usage. You can access the UI at http://localhost:3000 in your browser.

For production environment, we recommend using our [managed platform](https://www.lmnr.ai/projects) or `docker compose -f docker-compose-full.yml up -d`. 

`docker-compose-full.yml` is heavy but it will enable all the features.

- app-server â€“ core Rust backend
- rabbitmq â€“ message queue for reliable trace processing
- qdrant â€“ vector database
- semantic-search-service â€“ gRPC service for embedding text and storing/retrieving it from qdrant
- frontend â€“ Next.js frontend and backend
- python-executor â€“ gRPC service with lightweight Python sandbox that can run arbitrary code.
- postgres â€“ Postgres database for all the application data
- clickhouse â€“ columnar OLAP database for more efficient trace and label analytics

## Contributing

For running and building Laminar locally, or to learn more about docker compose files,
follow the guide in [Contributing](/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## TS quickstart

First, [create a project](https://www.lmnr.ai/projects) and generate a project API key. Then,

```sh
npm add @lmnr-ai/lmnr
```

It will install Laminar TS SDK and all instrumentation packages (OpenAI, Anthropic, LangChain ...)

To start tracing LLM calls just add
```typescript
import { Laminar } from '@lmnr-ai/lmnr';
Laminar.initialize({ projectApiKey: process.env.LMNR_PROJECT_API_KEY });
```

To trace inputs / outputs of functions use `observe` wrapper.

```typescript
import { OpenAI } from 'openai';
import { observe } from '@lmnr-ai/lmnr';

const client = new OpenAI({ apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY });

const poemWriter = observe({name: 'poemWriter'}, async (topic) => {
  const response = await client.chat.completions.create({
    model: "gpt-4o-mini",
    messages: [{ role: "user", content: `write a poem about ${topic}` }],
  });
  return response.choices[0].message.content;
});

await poemWriter();
```

## Python quickstart

First, [create a project](https://www.lmnr.ai/projects) and generate a project API key. Then,

```sh
pip install --upgrade 'lmnr[all]'
```
It will install Laminar Python SDK and all instrumentation packages. See list of all instruments [here](https://docs.lmnr.ai/installation)


To start tracing LLM calls just add
```python
from lmnr import Laminar
Laminar.initialize(project_api_key="<LMNR_PROJECT_API_KEY>")
```

To trace inputs / outputs of functions use `@observe()` decorator.

```python
import os
from openai import OpenAI

from lmnr import observe, Laminar
Laminar.initialize(project_api_key="<LMNR_PROJECT_API_KEY>")

client = OpenAI(api_key=os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"])

@observe()  # annotate all functions you want to trace
def poem_writer(topic):
    response = client.chat.completions.create(
        model="gpt-4o",
        messages=[
            {"role": "user", "content": f"write a poem about {topic}"},
        ],
    )
    poem = response.choices[0].message.content
    return poem

if __name__ == "__main__":
    print(poem_writer(topic="laminar flow"))
```

Running the code above will result in the following trace.
