Want to drop an entire Laminar trace inline in a post? You can now use the `<Trace>` MDX tag. Here's a live example pulled from a shared trace we seeded locally:

<Trace
  id="93745aae-90d5-4a10-8845-5705b8520f72"
  spanId="128282b5-5554-482a-9528-cf982e750f58"
  host="http://localhost:3000"
/>

Change the `host` to your deployed domain (e.g., `https://laminar.sh`) and swap in your own `id`. Optionally pass `spanId` to preselect a span. The trace must be set to **Public** for embeds to load.
