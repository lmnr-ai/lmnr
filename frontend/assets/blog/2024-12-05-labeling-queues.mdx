Every time a major LLM provider releases a new model, people tend to think about
how LLMs can replace humans in certain tasks. And this take is true – better, larger,
and potentially faster models can do much more than their predecessors.

However, many tasks are just too specific or require a lot
of domain knowledge, and off-the-shelf generalist LLMs are just not good enough out of the box.

There are many techniques to improve the task alignment of LLMs, ranging from
propmt engineering to fine-tuning, to training-time human feedback. The general idea
is that, just like in traditional ML, we need human feedback in a certain shape –
most often a well curated dataset.

This is where labeling comes into play. In a very broad sense, labeling is the process
wherein a human attaches a key-value pair to a (possibly generated) data point. The main
purpose of labeling is to distinguish and filter out different classes of data and ultimately
to collect a "good" dataset that can be used to train, fine-tune, or prompt-tune a model.

Regardless of what you are building – be it your production agent or an LLM-as-a-judge evaluator –
it is useless, if not harmful, without human alignment.

From our experience, teams benefit the most from labeling when:
- Multiple people are involved in the labeling process, potentially with overlapping datasets
- Domain experts are involved in the labeling process
- In case of LLM-as-a-judge, manual labeling is done with the same criteria as the LLM-as-a-judge

The biggest challenge is that domain experts are not necessarily familiar with the concepts
of spans, telemetry, and JSON. This makes it even harder to accomodate for both technical
and non-technical team members in the labeling process.

To address this, we've added a new feature to Laminar – labeling queues.

## Labeling Queues

Labeling queues are a way to label data in Laminar. They are designed to be simplistic views
where a user can see one data point at a time and can attach labels to it.

Data points in the queues are added first-in-first-out (FIFO) basis, but the person labeling
can move back and forth in the queue. This decision was deliberate, so labelers can't easily
see the entire queue, but can compare data points.

On Laminar, there are currently two ways to add data to the labeling queues:
- Exporting data from spans view
- When running evaluations, sending the same data points for human labeling

Getting started is simple. We first need to create a new labeling queue. Then,
we choose a span that we want to label and add it to that queue.

We can then see the span inside the labeling queue and attach labels to it.

As you can see, we can add labels and add reasoning/comments to each label value.

### Human labelers

Another mode to add data to the labeling queues is to run evaluations registering a 
human evaluator. This is useful when you want to run an LLM-as-a-judge evaluation and
ask humans to label the same data points – and then compare the results to track the
alignment of the LLM-as-a-judge.

To register a human evaluator, simply add an array of `HumanEvaluator` objects to the
evaluation configuration.

TypeScript:

```javascript
import { evaluate, HumanEvaluator } from '@lmnr-ai/lmnr';

evaluate({
    data: evaluationData,
    executor: async (data) => await getCapital(data),
    evaluators: { checkCapitalCorrectness: evaluator },
    projectApiKey: process.env.LMNR_PROJECT_API_KEY,
    humanEvaluators: [
        HumanEvaluator("my_queue"),
        HumanEvaluator("my_other_queue"),
    ],
})
```

Python:

```python
from lmnr import evaluate, HumanEvaluator
import os

evaluate(
    data=data,
    executor=get_capital,
    evaluators={'check_capital_correctness': evaluator},
    project_api_key=os.environ["LMNR_PROJECT_API_KEY"],
    human_evaluators=[
        HumanEvaluator(queue_name="my_queue"),
        HumanEvaluator(queue_name="my_other_queue")
    ],
)
```

When human labelers attach labels to the corresponding data points in the queue,
the numeric values are added back to the same evaluation and can be compared to the
evaluator's numeric values side by side.

Read more in our [docs](https://docs.lmnr.ai/evaluations/configuration#registering-human-evaluators).

### Actions

Labeling queues also have various actions. Numeric labels that go back to the evaluation
is one example. We start with an ability to add labeled data points to Laminar datasets
of your choice.

This is the simple basis, but we have plans to add more actions in the future to facilitate
numerous labeling workflows and empower the true data flywheel.

## The future

Labeling queues are a very new concept, and we are excited to see how they can be used
in practice. If you have interesting use cases in mind and ideas on how to improve the
feature, please let us know! We are always open to feedback and suggestions on
